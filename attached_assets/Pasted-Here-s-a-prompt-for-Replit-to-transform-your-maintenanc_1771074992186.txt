Here's a prompt for Replit to transform your maintenance screen into a more flexible requests & tasks system:

---

**Transform the Maintenance screen into a Requests & Tasks system with the following changes:**

**Page Header & Navigation:**
- Change page title from "MAINTENANCE" to "REQUESTS & TASKS"
- Update subtitle from "Track and manage property maintenance requests" to "Track and manage property requests and tasks"
- Keep the "NEW REQUEST" button but make it open a modal to select task type first

**Task Type System:**
- Add `task_type` field to each request/task with options:
  - Maintenance Request
  - Property Inspection
  - Move-In Preparation
  - Move-Out Inspection
  - Lease Renewal Process
  - Custom Task
- Display task type as a badge next to the title (similar to priority badges)
- Use different colors for different task types (maintenance=blue, inspection=purple, move-in/out=green, custom=gray)

**List View Enhancements:**
- Add task type badge before the title
- Keep existing priority badges (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- Add status icon (current circle icons are good)
- Show: [Status Icon] [Task Type Badge] TITLE [Priority Badge]
- Keep location/unit info, reported date, and assigned info

**Filter Updates:**
- Add "ALL TASK TYPES" dropdown next to "ALL BUILDINGS" filter
- Allow filtering by: All, Maintenance, Inspections, Move-In/Out, Custom
- Keep existing status filters (ALL REQUESTS, OPEN, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED)

**Detail Screen (when clicking a request):**
Display comprehensive info including:
- Task type and title at top
- Priority level
- Current status with status change history
- Property/Building and Unit information
- Description/Details
- Reported by (name, date/time)
- Assigned to (person/vendor)
- Due date
- Attachments/Photos section
- Activity timeline (status changes, comments, updates)
- Action buttons: Change Status, Reassign, Add Comment, Upload Photo, Edit

**Create New Request Modal:**
- First step: Select task type
- Second step: Form with fields based on task type
- Common fields: Title, Description, Priority, Property/Unit, Due Date, Assign To
- Task-specific fields as needed

Keep the existing visual design language (dark header, clean card layout, icons) but make it work for any type of request/task workflow, not just maintenance.
